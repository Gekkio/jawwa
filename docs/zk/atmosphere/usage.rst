Usage
=====

Since the module is just an implementation of the ZK server push API, please refer to `ZK server push documentation <http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK%20Developer%27s%20Reference/Server%20Push>`_.

**Warning! Only asynchronous tasks are supported (Executions.schedule), so using synchronous tasks (Executions.activate/deactivate) will throw an exception**.
